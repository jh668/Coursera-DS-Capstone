## Project Introduction
This project is to apply data science in the area of natural language processing. The English dataset provided by Coursera will be used as training data. The goal of the project is to build a prediction algorithm for predicting the next word. The following major tasks are completed:

1. Process the dataset provided by Coursera and generate a corpus based on the dataset
2. Generate tokens for the corpus and explore the frequencies of the tokens. 
3. Use n-gram method to build a prediction algorithm.
4. Build a Shiny app that takes as input a phrase in a text box input and outputs a predction of the next word.


## The Prediction Algorithm
The prediction algorithm is created based on the N-gram language modeling method:

- It predicts from up to the three last words of the input text.
- It is a 4-gram language model.
- It is based on a simple backoff method: matching the n-gram data from the higher-order (e.g. quad-grams) to the lower-order (e.g. bi-grams)
- The bi-grams, tri-grams, and quad-grams are developed from a sample corpus based on a training sample dataset (213,483 lines) from the coursera training data, which is composed of data sourced from twitter, news and blogs.


## The App
A Shiny app is created based on the n-gram prediction algorithm. In this app, user can input a phrase in the text box. The app will generate a prection of the next word.
